# ROTWK `game.dat` patching

Reverse-engineering + binary-patch work on the ROTWK SAGE engine (build `2.01.2614.37001`). The
patches below are all engine-level — they apply to any ROTWK install of that build and benefit
every mod on it (Edain among them), not one in particular. All of them target `game.dat` except
`desert-weather-wb`, which patches `Worldbuilder.exe` from the same install:

- **`commandset-limit`** raises the `CommandSet` button limit from its stock **33** to any **N** in
  34..127, plus the INI paging rule needed to surface the extra buttons, and widens the AI's
  set-walk to the same N. The shipped build uses **N = 64**.
- **`cah-factions`** teaches the nine-name Create-A-Hero faction enum a caller-supplied list of mod
  sides plus an `All` token, so a `SubClass` can name them in `UsableFactions`.
- **`ai-revive-gate`** makes the AI evaluate a `REVIVE` command button's `NeededUpgrade` before
  recruiting or reviving through it. The engine checks that requirement for the player and for
  `UNIT_BUILD` buttons, but not on the AI's revive path — so hero slots disabled by an
  unobtainable upgrade are player-only restrictions today. The gate applies **only to callers that
  ask `canMakeUnit` directly**, which is only ever the AI's own choice of producer; the ControlBar
  and production come in through `BuildAssistant`'s `+0x64` gate and keep the stock answer.
- **`production-condition`** adds a **model condition** that is active while a structure's
  production queue is non-empty — training a unit *or* researching an upgrade. The stock engine
  has no such state: the `DOOR_n_*` conditions run *after* a unit completes, as the buffer during
  which it walks out, and `ModelConditionUpgrade` fires on an upgrade's completion. Two **opt-in**
  extras ride the same trigger: `--weapon-set-flag NAME` adds a `WeaponSetFlag`, so a
  `WeaponSet Conditions = NAME` block can give a producer a different loadout while it is busy,
  and `--locomotor-set NAME` adds a `LocomotorSetType`, so `Locomotor = NAME <template>` can give
  it a different locomotor. Both of those tables are read through their terminator rather than a
  count, so each costs a relocation and nothing else, and objects declaring neither are
  unaffected.
- **`desert-weather`** adds a third global weather, **`DESERT`**, and a **`SAND`** model condition
  for it to drive - the pairing the engine already has for `SNOWY` → `SNOW`, and only for that one.
  A map carrying `weather = 2` (a plain `Integer` in its `WorldInfo` chunk, which is how the
  engine actually gets its weather - not `map.ini`) then sets `SAND` on every drawable the way a
  snowy map sets `SNOW`, and `WeatherTexture = DESERT …` works too. Note that `SAND` is **not** a
  stock model condition: the patch creates it, out of the same name table `production-condition`
  extends, so the two compose in either order.
- **`desert-weather-wb`** is the authoring half of that, and the one patch here that targets
  **`Worldbuilder.exe`** rather than `game.dat`. Worldbuilder's map-settings weather dropdown is
  filled by a loop with a hardcoded member count, so `DESERT` never appears in it - and because
  the OK handler stores `CB_GETCURSEL` unvalidated, opening that dialog on a `DESERT` map and
  pressing OK writes `-1` back into the map and silently reverts it. The patch grows the same
  table and raises that one bound. Dropdown only: the editor *viewport* keeps drawing the
  non-`SAND` variant, which needs Worldbuilder's own model-condition table extended too.
- **`replay-outcome`** writes **each player's final victory/defeat state into the replay**, at
  the frame the recording ends - whether a player left or the game finished. A stock replay
  records inputs, not state, so no chunk says who won and
  [`sage_replay.winner`](../sage_replay/winner.py) has to infer it from who stopped issuing
  orders (and gives up entirely on elimination endings and on AI players). This adds one `0x7D0`
  chunk per player, written straight to the recorder's own file handle just before the `0x1D`
  end-of-recording marker. Client-local: nothing enters the simulation and nothing crosses the
  network, so it does **not** have to be on every peer. **Runtime-verified** on all three endings
  — see Status.
- **`skirmish-replay`** makes a **single-player skirmish record a replay**, which the stock engine
  never does, and gives each recording a **timestamp + map** name instead of overwriting
  `Last Replay`. `startRecording` has exactly one caller — the `MSG_NEW_GAME` branch of
  `RecorderClass::updateRecord` — and it whitelists the game mode against `{1, 5}`, the two
  network flavours; a skirmish emits **2** and falls off the end of the list. Everything
  downstream already works: `startRecording` has a complete non-network path that builds the
  header from `TheSkirmishGameInfo`, and the engine's own playback predicate already accepts a
  *recorded* mode of 2. So the patch replaces nine bytes of whitelist and retargets the call that
  names the file. **By default every recording is renamed**, not just skirmishes: the fixed name
  means each game overwrites the last, and a file every player has under the same name is what
  makes replays impossible to collect. That costs the replay menu's Save Replay button, which
  exists only to rescue the file before it is overwritten (`--rename added` keeps the stock
  behaviour for network games). Client-local, like `replay-outcome`. **Gate runtime-verified,
  naming re-test open** — see Status.
- **`observer-switch`** makes a **skirmish replay let you change seat** — next/prior player, and
  with it that player's vision, palantir and unlocked spellbook — which a network replay already
  does. The palantir shows the observer bar on two conditions, and the failing one whitelists the
  *recorded* game mode against `{1, 5}`; a skirmish records **2**, so the buttons never appear.
  Nothing downstream is gated: the observer seat is installed on the playback mode, and the switch
  itself re-runs the shroud manager for the new seat. The engine already ships the same predicate
  with mode 2 added, so the patch aims one `call` at it — five bytes, no cave. The natural
  companion to `skirmish-replay`, and independent of it. Client-local. **Not yet runtime-verified
  in game.**
- **`spellstore-commandset-upgrade`** adds `PurchaseScienceCommandSetMP2` and
  `PurchaseScienceNeededUpgrade` to `PlayerTemplate`, then flips the SpellStore to MP2 while the
  owning player has the chosen upgrade. It leaves the ControlBar alone and only changes the UI
  command-set selection.
- **`terrain-resource-exp`** adds a **`GiveNoXP`** boolean to `TerrainResourceBehavior`, so a
  resource spot can pay its owner without levelling its own building. The module hands the integer
  it just deposited to the building's `ExperienceTracker` on every income tick, and no INI field
  separates the two — while the sibling `AutoDepositUpdate` has shipped exactly this boolean, under
  exactly this name, since the stock build. The new field lands in `ModuleData+0x16`, alignment
  padding the constructor never wrote, so nothing grows.
- **`unique-production-id`** mints the `ProductionID` **game-wide** instead of per building. The
  stock counter lives on the producer, so every building's first production is id 1 — and hero
  recruitment keys the player's revive bookkeeping on that id, so recruiting a hero from a second
  building while the first is still producing collides, and the click takes the money without
  starting anything.
- **`hero-mana`** gives special powers a **regenerating per-object cost** — `SpecialPower.ManaCost`
  for the price of one activation, and `Object.ManaPool` / `Object.ManaRegen` for the caster's
  single pool that all of its abilities draw on. The stock `UnitCost` field cannot do
  this: all three sites that read it ask `Object+0x258` for the horde interface first and, when
  it is absent, branch to *the same label as "cost is zero"* — so on a lone hero `UnitCost` is
  not a weak mechanic, it is a **no-op**. The patch grows `SpecialPowerTemplate` `0x88 → 0x94`,
  relocates both the `SpecialPower` field-parse table (**two** references, the smallest repoint
  here) and the `Object` one (**five**, and no interior reference despite what
  an earlier costing recorded),
  and enforces the cost at `SpecialPowerStore::canUseSpecialPower` — the one predicate the
  player's UI, the AI and every activation path all share, so **the AI is gated for free**. The
  pool is *computed on read* from the logic frame rather than ticked, which is what lets it need
  no per-frame hook (avoiding a collision with `live-bridge`), no init hook, no destroy hook and
  no savegame change. A `ManaCost` line joins the stock `UnitCost` one in a button's description,
  from the `TOOLTIP:ManaCost` key and carrying **both the price and what the caster currently has**;
  a `ManaPool` line sits under a hero's level on its revive/recruit button. `ManaCost = 0`, the default, leaves a power exactly as it is today.

- **`second-resource`** gives every player a **second resource pool** alongside gold, granted per
  tick by `AutoDepositUpdate.DepositAmount2` and seeded per faction by
  `PlayerTemplate.StartMoney2`, and shows it in brackets after the palantir's own number
  (`1000 (50)`), and lets an `Object.BuildCost2` price things in it — a priced button reads
  `Cost: 100 (25)` and is refused when the player is short. The
  counter is `UInt32 pool[20]` in the cave indexed by `Player::m_playerIndex` (no struct growth);
  the new `UInt16` lands in `ModuleData`'s alignment padding at `+0x22` and its default costs
  three bytes, because the constructor's two `Bool` stores collapse into one dword store that
  clears the padding too; and `StartMoney2` lives in a row table keyed by the template's
  `NameKeyType`, because `PlayerTemplate` has no hole (`+0x34` is the `Money` subobject's own
  `m_playerIndex`, not padding). The display needs **no `.apt` and no `.csf`**: like
  `APT:PalantirCommandPoints`, the resource text is formatted by the engine and pushed to the
  movie every refresh, so a second number is one more vararg on a call it already makes — plus
  widening the refresh's change filter, which otherwise leaves the bracket stale whenever gold
  sits still. `--no-hud` keeps the text stock. **Savegames are not supported** — a cave counter
  is not `Xfer`'d, so a load resets the pool. `BuildCost2` lives in the cave too, keyed by
  `ThingTemplate *`: the 2-byte gap at `+0x5E8` that looks free is the template's engine-assigned
  **id**, and the copy at `0x006D24AB` is field-by-field, so growing the struct would not even buy
  the copy — both routes need the same hook inside `copyFrom`. **The AI is out of scope by
  construction**: its unit variants leave `BuildCost2` at 0, and a cost of 0 short-circuits the
  shared gate before the pool is read. **Enforcement is not complete** — structure placement and
  upgrade research are refused correctly but not charged, and cancelling refunds no resource 2.
- **`command-point-upkeep`** makes a large army **cost a player income**: the more command points
  they have in the field, the less their resource buildings pay. Two new `PlayerTemplate` fields
  declare the curve per faction — `UpkeepCommandPointStep` (how many command points move a player
  one tier; **0, the default, is upkeep off**) and `UpkeepValues` (the percentage of income kept
  at each tier, the last entry held for everything past it). It is not a new mechanic so much as a
  second dial on an old one: `ResourceModifierValues` — the per-building "inflation" every Edain
  faction sets — is read in exactly **one** place, `AutoDepositUpdate::update`, which turns a
  *count* into a percentage and scales the deposit by it. Upkeep swaps the count for command
  points and multiplies the same slot, so the two stack and the engine's "never round income below
  1 gold" floor still applies. Only income the faction's own `ResourceModifierObjectFilter`
  accepts is taxed, because `AutoDepositUpdate` is *all* tick income and would otherwise catch
  captured neutral structures too. The per-faction rows live in the cave keyed by the template's
  `NameKeyType`, not by a pointer — a `PlayerTemplate` is parsed into a **stack temporary** before
  being copied into the store's vector — which is also what leaves **no savegame change and no
  init hook**. The `PlayerTemplate` field table has **one** reference, the smallest repoint here.
  The palantir's command-point readout gains the current loss: `500/1500 (-10%)`, produced by the
  engine's own formatter with a third vararg, so it needs no `.apt` and no `.csf`/`.str` edit
  (a mod's `APT:PalantirCommandPoints` string is a design-time placeholder the engine overwrites
  every refresh). `--no-hud` leaves the text stock.
- **`science-prereqs`** lets **`PrerequisiteSciences` name a science defined later in the file**,
  so a mutually dependent pair (`C` needs `A or D`, `D` needs `B or C`) no longer has to be closed
  from `map.ini`. It is the smallest patch here — one `rel32` and a 16-byte cave — because
  `ScienceType` **is** the `NameKeyType`: `getScienceFromInternalName` computes the key *before* it
  checks the name is known, and `nameToKey` mints a key for a name it has not seen, so a forward
  reference and a backward one store the identical dword. Removing the check cannot produce a
  degraded value, and a key that never gets a definition is one no player can hold, so the group is
  simply unsatisfiable. By default the safety net stays: every name that did not resolve is
  recorded, and a detour immediately after the `initSubsystem` call that loads `TheScienceStore`
  re-checks the list and throws the engine's own message for the first one still missing — the same
  text a modder sees today, because this build's INI handler never adds file and line to begin
  with. `--no-report-missing` drops that half; `--all-keywords` widens the relaxation to every
  science-name keyword by repointing the shared thunk instead. A `map.ini` that defines a `Science`
  block runs after the check and is not covered. **Not yet runtime-verified in game.**
- **`multi-execute-gate`** makes an **`OK_FOR_MULTI_EXECUTE` button respect each selected unit's own
  `EnableOnModelCondition` / `DisableOnModelCondition`**. Today it does not: the ControlBar lights
  the button if *any* member of the selection qualifies (reasonable), and the click then runs the
  ability on *every* member (not). The two rules never meet, because the click emits
  `MSG_DO_SPECIAL_POWER` with the button's `Options` word and an object id of **zero**, and zero
  means "the issuing player's whole selection" — so the logic side gets a `SpecialPowerTemplate` and
  never sees the `CommandButton` the masks live on. Its per-member gate does check required
  sciences, `UnitCost` and recharge; model conditions are simply not among the things it can ask
  about. This adds that one question to the two group loops, by recovering the button from the
  member itself through the engine's own object → command set → button walk — which reads the
  *effective* command set (the three per-object overrides ahead of the template's), so a mod that
  swaps sets at runtime still agrees with the button that was clicked. Two `rel32` and a
  `0xDB`-byte cave; the button stays `OK_FOR_MULTI_EXECUTE`, the loop still visits every member, and
  a member whose own button is disabled is skipped exactly as if it had failed the recharge check.
  This is what Edain's *Ambush of the Wood-elves* command-set swap works around, at the cost of the
  mass trigger. **Not yet runtime-verified in game.**
- **`spawn-union`** makes an object with several `SpawnBehavior`s use **all** of their spawns.
  `Object::getSpawnBehaviorInterface` walks the module list and returns on the **first** module that
  answers, so a structure with two of them orders only the first one's slaves to attack, asks only
  the first whether any slave can attack, and finds the closest slave only among the first — which
  is the whole of what `SPAWNS_ARE_THE_WEAPONS` means. The same getter carries a plain bug: a dying
  slave's death is reported to the first behavior alone, and `onSpawnDeath` returns having done
  nothing when the id is not in *its* list, so a second behavior's slaves die with no list removal,
  no live-count decrement and no respawn timer. Both spawn normally either way; spawning is each
  module's own update. The patch replaces the getter — one 5-byte `jmp` and a `0x4A7`-byte cave —
  with one that returns the stock answer for none and for one, and for two or more returns a
  **proxy** whose sixteen slots re-walk the list: `void` methods broadcast, predicates are OR'd
  (asking every behavior, no short-circuit), and `getClosestSlave` re-runs the distance comparison
  the stock implementation does internally, through the engine's own helper. Reentrancy is covered
  by a ring of eight proxies, since ordering slaves runs slave AI that comes back through the
  getter. **This one changes the simulation**, so it has to be on every peer and its replays will
  not play back on a stock build. **Not yet runtime-verified in game.**

- **`herobar`** adds a **`HEROBAR`** kindof: every instance of one `ThingTemplate` shares a single
  hero-bar slot, two different templates take two slots, and clicking a grouped slot selects the
  whole group. Different from `PORTER`, which collapses *every* porter into one slot whatever
  template it came from and clicks through them one at a time. It is cheap for two reasons. The
  kindof is free: `KindOfMaskType` is 224 bits with 222 named, so the new bit needs no
  `ThingTemplate` growth and no savegame change, and the table move is 14 references and 6 counts
  against `production-condition`'s 16 and 10. And the hero bar is already most of the way there -
  `slot+0x16` is a generic **"this slot is a group"** byte the click handler already dispatches on,
  and a group slot is drawn with the *same* ActionScript calls as a hero slot, so **no `.apt` edit
  is needed**. So the patch adds no drawing code at all: `HEROBAR` objects join the **hero** list
  the draw loop already walks, and three small detours around that loop clear a per-pass set of
  templates, send a duplicate to the engine's own "next node, no slot consumed" label, and mark the
  slot it did draw. The removal pair is not optional - the stock `onObjectRemoved` accepts only
  `HERO` and `PORTER`, so without it a dead `HEROBAR` object's node would sit on the list forever.
  **No count badge** (a group slot shows the representative's rank, not a member count) and the bar
  is still **16 slots**, so enough distinct groups push heroes off the end. **Not yet
  runtime-verified in game.**

`verify` re-derives the expected tables, the repointed references and every patched site from the
same parameters and checks them against the file — a structural, disassembler-free pass/fail.

## Telling the linter what the engine now accepts

A patch that adds an INI field or a name-table token changes what *valid data* looks like, and
`sage_ini`'s model describes the stock engine — so on a patched game the mod's own data reads as
a pile of unknown attributes and unknown enum tokens. `sagepatch` closes that: it reads the binary
and writes the `.sagepatch` that `sage_ini` and `sage_lint` load (see
[`sage_ini/engine.py`](../sage_ini/engine.py)).

```sh
sage-patch sagepatch game.dat -o /path/to/mod/.sagepatch   # commit it beside .sagelint
sage-patch sagepatch game.dat                              # to stdout, to review first
sage-patch sagepatch game.dat --check /path/to/mod/.sagepatch   # non-zero if it has drifted
sage-patch sagepatch --patch hero-mana --patch commandset-limit  # by name, no binary
```

It reads the **binary**, not a list of names you type, because that is the only thing that knows
what was actually built: which patches are in it, at what count, under which keyword, and which
token landed on which bit. Two passes do it, and they cover for each other — each patch is offered
the image through `Patch.detect` (which recovers its parameters) and contributes its declared
`Patch.ini_surface`, while the name tables are read live so *any* token past the stock ones is
recorded with its real index, including ones added by a patch applied under a custom name or by a
patch this package has never heard of. The `--patch` form skips the binary for a project that
would rather not wire a path into CI, at the cost of describing every patch with its defaults.

`--check` is the drift guard: run it in CI, and a committed `.sagepatch` that no longer matches
the binary the team ships fails the build instead of silently mislinting.

## The patch framework

`apply_patches(game_dat, patches, output=None)` applies an ordered list of `Patch` subclasses to a
copy of the binary and writes the result (in-place if `output` is omitted). Each `Patch` verifies
the bytes it expects before writing, so a list either applies in full or raises without leaving a
half-patched file.

```python
from sage_patch import AiReviveGatePatch, apply_patches, CahFactionsPatch, CommandSetLimitPatch

apply_patches(
    "game.dat.backup",
    [
        CommandSetLimitPatch(count=64),
        CahFactionsPatch(sides=["Rohan", "Lothlorien"]),
        AiReviveGatePatch(),
    ],
    output="game.dat",
)

`CommandSetLimitPatch(count=N)`. **`count` may be 34–127**; every offset, the object size, the
field-parse table, the slot-name strings and the AI's scan bound are derived from it.

`CahFactionsPatch(sides=[...])`. **At most 22 sides**, each matching a `PlayerTemplate`'s `Side`
string exactly; the table, the name strings, the parser wrapper and the resolver's scan bound are
all derived from the list. `All` is always added, and expands to every bit at parse time so no
gate needs patching. See [`docs/cah-faction-limit.md`](docs/cah-faction-limit.md).

`AiReviveGatePatch()`. **No parameters** — there is one revive branch and one correct edge to add.
It hooks 6 bytes and adds a 58-byte `.aigate` cave whose only job is to reach the engine's existing
upgrade gate with the matched slot already counted — and only when the caller asked
`canMakeUnit` directly, which is only ever the AI deciding which producer to use. Anything that
came in through `BuildAssistant`'s `+0x64` gate (the ControlBar, `queueCreateUnit`, scripts) takes
the stock edge, so the patch cannot hide a button or refuse a production. See
[`docs/ai-revive-gate.md`](docs/ai-revive-gate.md).

`ProductionConditionPatch(condition="PRODUCING", weapon_set_flag=None, locomotor_set=None)`.
**One condition**, plus the two opt-in extras. It extends the `ModelConditionFlags` name table
into a `.prodmc` cave, repoints its 16 references, raises 10 count bounds and hooks the 5-byte
entry of `ProductionUpdate::update`; each extra adds its own table to the same cave and repoints
its own 8 references. All three blocks are **level-triggered**, guarding on their own state rather
than on one shared edge — the model-condition bit survives a savegame and the weapon-set bit does
not, so an edge-triggered hook would come back from a load with the two disagreeing for good. See
[`docs/production-model-condition.md`](docs/production-model-condition.md) §10-11.

It installs one because it implements one *trigger*, not because bits are scarce: 591 names sit in
a 19-dword mask, leaving 17 slots, and savegames store conditions as a **list of names** rather
than a bit layout, so the count does not affect them. **If you only need more conditions and not
more triggers, you probably need no patch at all** — the stock table already carries 75 `USER_*`
conditions with no engine behaviour of their own, of which Edain references 49, leaving ~26 free.

> **Every peer must run the same patched binary.** The bit lives on the logic-side `Object` and is
> part of what the engine CRCs, so a patched and an unpatched client desync as soon as a building
> starts producing, and replays do not cross. That is stricter than the other bundled patches,
> which are data-shape changes.

`ReplayOutcomePatch()`. **No parameters** — there is one moment a recorded game ends and one
state to write at it. It retargets the five-byte `call writeToFile` at `0x0077F98B`, inside
`RecorderClass::updateRecord`'s `MSG_CLEAR_GAME_DATA` branch — the consumer every ending
converges on, since the message itself has **thirteen** emitters and a quit and a finished game
use different ones — into a `.rpout` cave that walks `TheVictoryConditions`' player list and
`fwrite`s one 23-byte chunk per player to the recorder's own `FILE*`: order type `0x7D0`, the
player's `m_playerIndex` in the chunk's number field, then two Integers (outcome
0 undetermined / 1 victorious / 2 defeated, and the frame that player was defeated on).
`sage_replay.winner.recorded_outcomes` reads them back and `infer_winner` prefers them over the
concession heuristic outright. See [`docs/replay-outcome.md`](docs/replay-outcome.md).

> **This one does not need every peer.** The cave writes to a file the client already owns and
> injects nothing into the message stream, so a patched and an unpatched client stay in sync and
> replays still cross. That is the opposite of `production-condition`, whose bit is CRC'd.

`SkirmishReplayPatch(modes=(2,), rename="all")`. **`modes` are the `MSG_NEW_GAME` game modes to
record on top of the stock `{1, 5}`**; 2 is the one the skirmish setup screen emits, and a mode
the engine already records is refused rather than silently accepted. Two edits, both inside the
recorder: the nine-byte whitelist tail at `0x0077F910` (`cmp eax, 5` / `jne`) becomes a jump into
a `.rpskir` cave that tests 5 plus the table and lands back on the recorder's own accept
(`0x0077F919`) or reject (`0x0077F9DD`); and the `call` at `0x0077EA45` that asks for the file's
base name is retargeted to a second routine that writes `YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS <map>`.

**`rename="all"` (the default) renames every recording**, so no two replays collide and a file
can be handed to someone as-is. `rename="added"` renames only the modes `modes` enables and
tail-jumps to the stock helper otherwise, leaving network recordings byte-identical. The trade
is the replay menu's Save Replay button — see Status. See
[`docs/skirmish-replay.md`](docs/skirmish-replay.md).

> **Do not read `RecorderClass::m_gameMode` from inside `startRecording`.** `updateRecord`
> caches the mode there, but `startRecording`'s first act is `reset()`, which overwrites it with
> the sentinel 9 (`0x0077D7D2`) before the file is named. The mode is `startRecording`'s own
> second argument, `[ebp+0x0C]` — the value it writes into the header. This cost a build.

> **Also client-local, and it composes with `replay-outcome`.** The two hook opposite ends of
> `RecorderClass::updateRecord` — the `MSG_NEW_GAME` whitelist and the `MSG_CLEAR_GAME_DATA`
> `writeToFile` call — and neither reads what the other writes. Applied together, a skirmish
> records **and** names its winner, which is the only way `sage_replay` can resolve a game
> against an AI at all: the concession heuristic needs orders, and an AI issues none.

`ObserverSwitchPatch()`. No parameters, no cave, and one `call` — five bytes at `0x006D7813`.

The palantir shows or hides the observer bar (the APT clip `ObserverStuff`, holding
`NextPlayerBttn` and `PriorPlayerBttn`) on the AND of two predicates: *is the local player sitting
out* — true in any replay — and `0x0062541E`, which whitelists the **recorded** game mode against
`{1, 5}`. A skirmish records **2**, so a skirmish replay never gets the bar and there is no way to
change seat. Everything downstream already works: the observer seat is installed on the *playback*
mode (3, whatever was recorded), and `PlayerList::observeNextPlayer` gates on nothing that cares
about skirmish — it sets the observed player and re-runs `TheShroudManager` for that seat, which is
the vision. The engine even ships the right predicate: `0x00625456` is the same function with mode
2 added on both sides, has 31 callers, and is the one `skirmish-replay` already cites as proof
playback anticipates a mode-2 recording. So the patch aims the call at it. See
[`docs/observer-switch.md`](docs/observer-switch.md).

> **`0x0062541E` has exactly one caller**, and it is this gate — so retargeting the call removes
> the network-only predicate from the running binary rather than changing what some other feature
> sees. The two functions are **adjacent**, which is why the patch anchors both by their first
> bytes: a displacement off by a few lands in real code, not in a hole.

> **Client-local, like `replay-outcome` and `skirmish-replay`.** `observeNextPlayer` issues no
> `GameMessage`; it moves a camera and re-evaluates a shroud. One spillover: the bar now also
> appears in a *live* skirmish once the local player is defeated — exactly what the stock engine
> does in a live network game, and impossible while you are still playing.

`SecondResourcePatch(hud=True)`. Three INI fields — `AutoDepositUpdate.DepositAmount2`,
`PlayerTemplate.StartMoney2`, `Object.BuildCost2` — and ten hooks around a `.res2` cave.

The mechanic: the module's own `call Money::deposit` and `queueCreateUnit`'s
`call Money::withdraw` (five bytes each, so one whole instruction displaced), `Player::init`'s
entry (which both seeds the pool per faction and clears it per game, because `PlayerList`'s reset
calls it on all twenty slots with a NULL template), the `PlayerTemplate` block key at `0x005FE880`
— the six bytes *before* the ones `command-point-upkeep` takes, so the two compose — the one
affordability comparison in `BuildAssistant`'s `+0x64` gate, and the id copy inside
`ThingTemplate::copyFrom`, which is what carries a cost across an INI override block.
`hero-mana` rides that same copy from its *call site*, so the two share no byte.

The display: the palantir's text builder and its change filter, plus the two `TOOLTIP:Cost` lines
that price a template. All three field tables are rebuilt in the cave from whatever is live, one
4-byte repoint each (five for `Object`).

**The bracket is decided at INI load**, by a flag both parse functions raise on a non-zero value,
so a mod that mentions neither field gets the stock readout byte for byte and a mod that uses
either always shows the bracket. Deciding it from the pool would make the readout grow and lose a
number mid-game. `--no-hud` drops both palantir hooks and leaves the mechanic.

**Savegames are not supported** — the pool lives in the cave and is not `Xfer`'d, so a load
resets it. **Enforcement is partial**: the shared gate refuses everything a player cannot pay for,
but only unit production debits the pool, so a structure placed or an upgrade researched is
correctly refused and then costs nothing. See
[`docs/second-resource.md`](docs/second-resource.md) §9.

`UniqueProductionIdPatch()`. **No parameters** — there is one id mint and one right answer. It
rewrites the ten bytes of `ProductionUpdateInterface::requestUniqueUnitID` in place (ten for ten,
so no hook and no displaced instruction) to draw from a four-byte counter in a `.prodid` section
instead of the per-producer one at `ProductionUpdate+0x30`. The first id minted is still 1, and 0
is still never minted — which matters, because 0 is what an idle hero's revive entry holds in the
field the id is matched against. See [`docs/unique-production-id.md`](docs/unique-production-id.md).

`TerrainResourceExpPatch(keyword="GiveNoXP")`. **One keyword**, and the default is the name the
stock `AutoDepositUpdate` already gives the same field, so a mod writes one keyword for one concept
across both income modules. Three edits and a `0xC5`-byte `.trexp` cave: the constructor's two
`Bool` stores become `and dword [esi+0x14], 0` plus the same `Visible` store — eight bytes for
eight, and the `and` clears the new field on the way past, so the default costs nothing; the
field-parse table is rebuilt in the cave with a ninth row, which is **one** 4-byte repoint because
the table has exactly one reference and is read through its terminator rather than a count; and a
6-byte hook on the experience block runs `AutoDepositUpdate`'s own gate, `cmp byte
[ModuleData+off], 0` / `jne <past the grant>`, instruction for instruction. See
[`docs/terrain-resource-exp.md`](docs/terrain-resource-exp.md).

> **Every peer must run the same patched binary**, and a mod using the keyword cannot run without
> it at all — an unknown field in a known block is an INI parse error, not a warning. See Status.

`MultiExecuteGatePatch(slots=None)`. **Effectively no parameters** — there is one missing check and
one place it belongs. Two `rel32` repoints and a `0xDB`-byte `.mxgate` cave holding one predicate
and two shims: the `call <per-member precondition gate>` that opens each of the two `AIGroup`
special-power loops (`0x0076F6DA` for the targetless form, `0x00770B67` for the targeted ones) is
retargeted at a shim that asks the predicate first and otherwise tail-jumps to the stock gate, so
its own `ret` lands back in the loop. The predicate resolves the member's *effective* command set
(`Object::getCommandSetString`, which reads three per-object overrides before the template's own
field — so a command-set swap is honoured), finds the `SPECIAL_POWER` button whose power id matches
the one the group was told to run, and answers false only when
[the engine's own model-condition gate](docs/multi-execute-gate.md) calls that button disabled on
that object. No match, no command set, no masks — all answer true, which is the stock behaviour.

`slots` is the `CommandSet` slot bound the walk uses; `None` reads it out of the image, which is
`33` unless `commandset-limit` raised it. That makes this the one bundled pair with an **order**:
apply `commandset-limit` first. Applied the other way round nothing corrupts — a button past the
bound is not found, and that member takes the stock path — but `verify` reports the disagreement and
`detect` answers "not patched". See [`docs/multi-execute-gate.md`](docs/multi-execute-gate.md).

> **Every peer must run the same patched binary.** This changes which objects a logic-side order
> reaches, so a patched and an unpatched client diverge on the first multi-execute activation of a
> model-conditioned button, and replays do not cross — the same requirement `production-condition`
> carries, and the opposite of the client-local `replay-outcome` / `skirmish-replay`.

### Composing patches

**Any subset of the bundled patches applies in any order**, and a patch is only considered done
when it holds that. `apply_patches` takes a list precisely so they can be stacked:

```sh
sage-patch apply commandset-limit --count 64 --in game.dat.backup --out game.dat
sage-patch apply cah-factions --sides Rohan,Lothlorien --in game.dat --out game.dat
```

Three rules make that work, in decreasing order of how mechanically they hold:

| rule | enforced by | if broken |
|---|---|---|
| Allocate a cave with `allocate_section` (never a fixed RVA) and find it again with `find_section` | the helper — a patch that uses it cannot get this wrong | the section table comes out unsorted when another patch's cave is already present |
| Do not edit bytes another patch edits | not prevented, but `apply_byte_patch` asserts the original bytes first | the second patch to reach the site **raises**; nothing is silently corrupted |
| Do not derive your output from bytes another patch rewrites | nothing — this is the one the framework cannot catch | both orders "succeed" and disagree; declare the dependency in the docstring instead |

No bundled patch touches another's bytes or reads what another writes, and all three allocate their
cave the same way — so any order produces binaries that differ only in which cave landed first
(and therefore in the pointers to it), all verifying clean.

The one pair worth naming: `commandset-limit` and `ai-revive-gate` both edit
`BuildAssistant::canMakeUnit` — the hook at `0x7950ce` (6 bytes) and the AI scan bound at
`0x7950e2` (4 bytes), 20 bytes apart, no intersection. `ai-revive-gate`'s cave jumps only to
`0x79502a`, `0x7950dc` and `0x7950df`, all below the bound, so neither reads what the other writes.
[`tests/sage_patch/test_ai_revive_gate.py`](../tests/sage_patch/test_ai_revive_gate.py) asserts
both halves of that.

Placement being computed rather than hardcoded costs nothing: on an unpatched image
`next_section_rva` returns exactly the `0xAD3000` that `commandset-limit` used to name as a
constant, so a lone `commandset-limit` build still puts `.cmdext` where it always did.

> **Why 127 and not more.** Six patch sites encode the limit as a *signed 8-bit* immediate
> (`6a NN` push, `83 fa NN` / `83 fb NN` / `83 7d f8 NN` cmp). At 128 the byte `0x80` decodes as
> `-128`, and one of those pushes supplies `rep stosd`'s counter — the constructor would zero ~4
> billion dwords. Going higher means re-encoding those six as imm32 (3 bytes longer apiece), which
> no longer fits in place and needs relocated code, not a byte patch.

Tests live in [`tests/sage_patch/test_patching.py`](../tests/sage_patch/test_patching.py) and
[`tests/sage_patch/test_ai_revive_gate.py`](../tests/sage_patch/test_ai_revive_gate.py), including
a byte-identity check that `count=64` reproduces the shipped `game.dat`.

> **Rebuild `engine/game.dat` once after this change.** `commandset-limit` now writes a 15th
> Phase-1 edit (the AI scan bound), so a `count=64` build no longer matches an `engine/game.dat`
> produced before it, and the byte-identity check will fail until the artifact is rebuilt from
> `game.dat.backup`.

## Module reference

```sh
python scripts/module_defaults.py game.dat \
    --json docs/module-reference.json \
    --markdown docs/module-reference.md \
    --enums docs/ini-types.json         # needs your own game.dat
python scripts/build_wiki.py            # -> build/wiki/index.html, no game.dat needed
```

A field's type is its parse function, and those are identified from what the code does:
the constant a real is scaled by (`pi/180` is degrees in, radians out), the range the
parser complains about (`expected > 0`), the name array a token is resolved against, the
field table a nested block hands to the INI reader.

Block types are found the same way. The loader dispatches a block on `{keyword, parser}`
pairs in the data sections; a candidate is kept only when its parser really does hand a
field table to the INI reader, which is what makes it a block type rather than a string
that happens to sit next to a function pointer. Where the parser also allocates and
constructs its instance, the same constant tracking recovers that block's defaults.

The site is a build artefact and is not committed; the JSON it reads is.
